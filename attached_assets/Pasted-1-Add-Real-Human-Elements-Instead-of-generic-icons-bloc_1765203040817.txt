1. Add Real Human Elements

Instead of generic icons & blocks:

Add photos of your team or workspace

Add case study thumbnails instead of vector icons

Add project success numbers like:

Trusted by 17+ engineering clients
Completed 46 projects in CFD, CAD & Electronics

2. Introduce Layout Asymmetry

Right now everything is perfectly centered and symmetrical.

Try:

Left side form + right side contact info not equal widths

Cards that have different heights based on content

Breaking the grid using overlapping elements

Example concept:

| Form (70%)      | Contact info box (30%)

3. Replace Neon / Glow UI With Realistic Surfaces

Use:

Flat background with subtle grain texture

Softer gradients, less glow

Matte surfaces instead of glass blur

4. Improve Typography Hierarchy

Current typography uses same weight everywhere. Make it human and editorial:

Headings: bold + large

Subtitles: medium

Description: small & light

Labels: uppercase, letter-spaced

Example:

SELECT YOUR SERVICE
We help bring engineering ideas to life with CAD, CFD & PCB expertise.

5. Add Micro-Copy & Storytelling

Instead of robotic:

3D CAD Design — Professional modeling & rendering

Use narrative human tone:

We help you turn rough sketches into fully engineered 3D CAD models, ready for manufacturing.

6. Add Real Engineering Visuals

Replace icons with:

Photos of actual CAD assemblies

CFD simulation screenshots

PCB renders

Real project samples

7. Add Form Personality

Instead of placeholder text like "John Doe", use friendly examples:

Full Name
eg: Pranav Suresh

Tell us about your project
eg: Need CFD analysis for an optimized heat exchanger

8. Add Award / Trust / Review sections

Real brands feel human because they show people who trust them.

Examples:

Client testimonials with profile pictures

Company logos

Before-after comparison

“Meet the Team” section
