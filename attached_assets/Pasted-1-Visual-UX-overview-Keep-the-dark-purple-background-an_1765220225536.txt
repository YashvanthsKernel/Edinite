1) Visual & UX overview

Keep the dark purple background and glass cards style (backdrop-filter blur + semi-transparent panels), but add depth, motion, and clear hierarchy.

Make each step a card with: small step label (01 / STEP 1), an icon, short title, 1–2 line summary, and a micro “read more” action that opens a focused detail pane/modal.

Layout: a horizontal carousel/timeline on desktop with a central active card that’s visually highlighted; on mobile switch to a vertical stacked stepper with expandable sections.

2) Layout & composition (desktop)

Container width: max 1200px, centered.

Visual center: display 4 cards in a horizontal row but with the center two visually elevated; use perspective + subtle parallax so center card appears closest. If odd number of steps, center the active step.

Card spacing: 28–36px horizontal gutter.

Connectors: thin animated SVG lines/arcs between cards. Lines glow softly on hover and animate a subtle traveling particle (small dot) to indicate flow from left → right.

Accent ring: each card has a circular step badge (small number inside). The active card’s badge uses a gradient neon border and subtle radial glow.

3) Card design (glass details)

Card base:

backdrop-filter: blur(8px)

background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.02), rgba(255,255,255,0.01))

border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.06) plus box-shadow: 0 8px 30px rgba(10, 0, 30, 0.6)

corner radius: 18px

padding: 28px

min-height: 200px (desktop)

Active card (center):

scale: 1.06 transform on desktop

border: 1px solid rgba(160, 80, 255, 0.35) with inner neon accent line (2px) on bottom edge

background highlight: faint conic-gradient overlay (very subtle, 3–5% opacity)

Typography inside card:

Step label (small caps): 12px, letter-spacing 1px, color #b9a9ff

Title: 20–22px semi-bold, color #fff

Body: 14px regular, color #d7d3f6 (soft contrast)

CTA “Read more” link: underline animation on hover

Icons:

Use thin line icons (stroke 1.5–2px) filled with subtle accent color on active card. Keep icon set consistent.

4) Color & design tokens

Primary palette (dark glass theme):

Background dark: #0b0710

Deep purple accent: #6B3DF2 (use for neon outlines)

Secondary cyan accent: #00D4FF (for step 3 etc.)

Soft text: #D7D3F6

Muted label: #B9A9FF

Connector glow: rgba(107,61,242,0.18)

Accessibility:

Ensure text contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 for titles; body text should remain >= 3:1 with slightly larger size if needed. Provide hover/focus states that increase contrast.

5) Motion & interactions

Entrance: when roadmap enters viewport, animate cards with a staggered vertical reveal (translateY 20px → 0) and fade (opacity 0 → 1). Stagger = 80ms. Duration = 600ms, easing = cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.2,1).

Hover: card raises on hover (translateY -8px), subtle shadow intensifies. Active card (or focused) gently scales to 1.06.

Connector animation: SVG stroke-dashoffset animation to create a flowing line; a small moving particle travels the connector when the corresponding card becomes active. Particle movement duration = 1.6s, infinite subtle loop when hovered.

Click: clicking a card centers it (animate translate and scale) and opens a detail panel (slide-up modal or side drawer) with additional deliverables, timeline, examples, CTA. Drawer animation = 320ms slide + fade.

Keyboard & focus: arrow keys left/right cycle active card; Enter opens details. Focus ring visible (2px outline in accent color).

Recommended libs: GSAP for complex timeline animations, or Framer Motion for React. For lightweight, use IntersectionObserver + CSS transitions + small JS for transforms.

6) Detail panel (on click / tap)

Lightweight pane that overlays page with blurred background (increase backdrop blur for focus).

Content: larger title, 2–3 bullets of deliverables, 1 image thumbnail or animated micro-gif of CAD/mesh, timeframe, CTA buttons Request Quote and See Samples.

Include downloadable sample button (STEP/ZIP).

7) Mobile behavior

Convert to vertical stepper: stacked cards with thin vertical line on left showing progress.

The active step expands to reveal full copy; collapsed steps show title + 1-line summary.

Swipe left/right to change active step if in horizontal mode (for smaller tablets).

Keep tap targets >= 44px.

8) Copy + microcopy (ready to paste)

Section title: The Roadmap to Excellence
Intro line: Four predictable stages — one reliable delivery. See how we take an idea to production-ready CAD.

Steps (short):

Innovation First — Cutting-edge tools and methods to crystallize your idea into a testable concept.

Precision Driven — Industry processes ensuring accuracy in every deliverable.

Collaborative Spirit — We work with your team to align engineering and business goals.

Excellence Standard — Committed to delivering manufacturable, production-ready designs.

Active CTA in card detail: Talk to an engineer
Confirmation microcopy: We reply within 1 business day (display near CTA)

9) Micro-interaction details (tiny polish that sells)

On active card reveal, show a subtle particle burst behind the step badge (very low opacity) for 450ms.

Floating faint orbital curve behind the center cards (SVG path) gently animates to suggest motion.

Add a “progress indicator” below the roadmap showing 25% 50% 75% 100% as you move across steps (or display the step number like Step 2 / 4).
