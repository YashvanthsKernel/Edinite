🌐 Project Title

Engineering Design & Simulation Website – Glassmorphism 3D Landing Page

🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and develop a modern, professional, and visually stunning website for an engineering company that provides end-to-end design and simulation services.

The website should communicate innovation, technical expertise, and reliability through its aesthetic — featuring 3D glassmorphism, floating elements, and smooth animations on a dark, futuristic theme.

This project delivers a single-page landing site with scope for expansion into a multi-page portfolio.

🧠 Client Background
