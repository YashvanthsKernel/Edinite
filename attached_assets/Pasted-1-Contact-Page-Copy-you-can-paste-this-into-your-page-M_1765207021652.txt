2️⃣ Optional: Layout + Style Prompt (for your own use)

You can use this as an internal “design brief” when editing your Replit project:

Design a clean, human-feeling contact page for Edinite – Engineering Design & Simulation Excellence.
The layout has:

A hero at the top with the heading: “Let’s Build Something That Actually Works”, and sub-text about turning ideas into validated designs with a 1–2 business day response promise.

Below that, a two-column layout:

Left column: “Talk to a human” block with short friendly copy, email, phone/WhatsApp, hours, and location. It should feel approachable, like you’re messaging a real engineer, not a corporate bot.

Right column: A structured contact form with fields for Name, Work email, Company, “What do you need help with?” dropdown, Project details textarea, Timeline, and Budget range, plus a CTA button “Send to Edinite”.

Use plenty of whitespace, subtle card borders or soft shadows, and typography that matches the rest of the Edinite site.

No stock-photo overload, no AI-ish gradients everywhere; just a small, subtle line illustration or icon related to engineering/simulation if needed.

Fully responsive: on mobile, the form stacks under the contact info with good padding and large tap targets
