1. Switch to a Card Hover Interaction With Depth

Instead of flat images, give each project card:

Smooth 3D lift + shadow glow on hover

Slight scale-up animation for interaction feedback

Glassmorphism overlay for text panel

Example interaction concept

Default view: Image fully visible with minimal text

On hover: Dark gradient overlay slides up + detailed info + button appears

2. Redesign Text Layout

Right now headings feel disconnected. Instead, try structured typography:

Current Issue	Improvement Idea
Small thin subtitle	Use bold category label with accent color
Project title hidden inside image	Add title outside + gradient overlay for clarity
Tags scattered	Place tags in neat pill container below title

Example hierarchy

Mechanical Design
Automotive Suspension Design
[SolidWorks] [ANSYS] [MATLAB]
↗ Case Study / Explore More button

3. Add Card Layout Split + Motion

Try a layout where:

Left side = image

Right side = text description + tools + CTA

On hover, image animates subtly

This provides readability and avoids covering the image.

4. Use Color-coded Themes

Identify engineering fields with visual accents:

Category	Accent Color
Mechanical	Orange / Brass tone
Thermal / CFD	Cyan / Gradient rainbow
Electrical	Yellow
AI/Software	Purple

Use these colors in:

Card borders

Tag backgrounds

Hover animation

5. Add Micro Details for Premium Look

Small icon next to each software tag

Subtle blur/shine animation on edge of card

Progress timeline or metric highlight badges:

Design Accuracy: 0.05mm

Optimized flow rate +27%

6. Improve CTA

Current "View All Projects" button is small and generic.

Replace with:
👉 View Full Case Study
→ Right arrow icon with motion

Make main CTA block:

View All Projects →


With hover effect:

Expand underline animation

Background neon glow

7. Add Motion Transition When Switching Cards

When user hovers or clicks, fade between:

Full engineering drawing

Real rendered output

This looks extremely premium and professional.

✨ Visual Inspiration (Concept Style)

Imagine something like:

 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 |  [Image - slight parallax movement]         |
 |   Mechanical Engineering                     |
 |   Automotive Suspension Design               |
 |   Short one-line description                |
 |   [SolidWorks] [ANSYS] [MATLAB]              |
 |   View Case Study  →                         |
 └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

🎯 Final Goal

Transform from simple image gallery → interactive engineering showcase that feels world-class, technical, and premium.
